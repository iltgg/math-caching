            <strong>Midpoint -</strong> Point that divides a line segment into two equal line segments.<br>
            <strong>Equidistant -</strong> Equally distant.<br>
            <strong>Bisector -</strong> The point or a line that divides a line or angle into two equal parts.<br>
            <strong>Right Bisector -</strong>The line that passes through the midpoint of a line segment and intersects it
            at a 90° angle.

            The average of the two opposite points of a line will give you the midpoint.<br>
            <strong>Midpoint equation -</strong> \((\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2})\)<br>
            The length of a line segment can be deduced from the run, rise, and Pythagorean Theorem:<br>
            \(run^2 + rise^2 = length^2\), isolating length gives the following equation:<br>
            \(d=\sqrt{(run)^2+(rise)^2}\)<br>
            This can also be represented in an equation using the points of the line.<br>
            <strong>Length of a line segment -</strong> \(d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}\)
        </p>
    
        <p>
            h and k represent how offset the center of the circle is from the origin.<br>
            x and y represent a point on the circle.<br>
            <strong>Equation of a circle -</strong> \((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2\)
        </p>
    
        <p>
            <strong>Concurrent -</strong> Meeting at a single point.<br>
            <strong>Median -</strong> Line segment joining a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side,
            bisects the area of the triangle.<br>
            <strong>Altitude -</strong> The height of a geometric shape.<br>
            <strong>Centroid -</strong> The point where the three medians of a triangle intersect, also the center of
            mass.<br>
            <strong>Circumcenter -</strong> The point of intersection of the three right bisectors of a triangle.<br>
            <strong>Centroid -</strong> The point where the three medians of a triangle intersect.<br>
            <strong>Incenter -</strong> The point at which the three angle bisectors of a triangle meet.<br>
            <strong>Orthocenter -</strong> The point at which the three altitudes of a triangle meet.

                Bob lives at (-8, 8) and Alice lives at (2, -4), the city is placing a wind turbine in their area, the
                zoning laws state that it must be equally distant from each house. The wind turbine must also be built on an
                existing power line, if the power line has an equation of \(y=-\frac{1}{2}x-7.5\) where must the wind
                turbine be built? Input answer with two comma-space separated values in parentheses, e.g. (1, -1)

                The radius of a circle can be found with the equation of a circle, we first need to find the center of a
