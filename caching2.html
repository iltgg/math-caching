            <strong>Non-linear relation -</strong> A relationship between two variables that does not follow a straight
            line
            when
            graphed.<br>
            <strong>Curve of best fit -</strong> A smooth curve drawn to approximate the general path or trend in a
            scatter
            plot.<br>
            <strong>Independent variable -</strong> The variable that you control, usually the x axis.<br>
            <strong>Dependent variable -</strong> The variable that is different depending on the independent variable,
            usually the y
            axis.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong> Quadratic equation -</strong> An equation in the form \(y=ax^2+bx+c\) where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)
            are
            real numbers and
            \(a\neq0\).<br>
            <strong>Parabola -</strong> The graph of quadratic relation, which is U-shaped and symmetrical.<br>
            <strong>Vertex -</strong> The point on the parabola where the cure changes direction, maximum point or
            minimum
            point depending if
            the parabola opens up down or up.<br>
            <strong>X-intercept/zero -</strong> The point where the graph intercepts the x axis. Parabolas have one,
            two, or
            zero.<br>
            <strong>Axis of symmetry -</strong> The line that divides a figure into two congruent parts.<br>
            <strong>Finite differences -</strong> Differences found from the y-values in a table with evenly spaced
            x-values, first
            differences are the differences between consecutive y-values, second differences are the difference between
            consecutive first differences.<br>
            <img src="images/differences.png" width="500"><br>
            In a quadratic relation the second differences are constant, but the first differences are not.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Take the base graph of \(y=x^2\):<br>
            \(y=x^2+k\) - Translates graph k units vertically, if greater than 0, graph is translated upwards, if less
            than
            0, graph is translated downward.<br>
            \(y=ax^2\) - Graph is stretched by a factor of a, if a is negative the graph is reflected on the x axis. If
            \(a
            > 1\text{ or }a < -1\) then the graph is stretched vertically. If \(-1> a > 0 \text{ or }0 < a < 1\) then the graph is compressed vertically. <br>
                    \(y=(x-h)^2\) - Translates the graph horizontally, if h is positive then
                    the graph is translated to the right, if h is negative then the graph is translated to the left.
                    <br>
                    This can all be expressed in the <strong>vertex form:</strong> \(a(x-h)^2+k\)<br>
                    <strong>Vertex:</strong> (h, k)<br>
                    <strong>Axis of symmetry:</strong> \(x=h\)<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            A quadratic relation in the form \(y=a(x-r)(x-s)\) is the <strong>intercept form</strong>.<br>
            The x intercepts, or zeros are \(r\) and \(s\).<br>
            The x coordinate of the vertex is the midpoint between both x intercepts.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            When a non-zero number is raised to the exponent 0, the result is 1.<br>
            When a non-zero base is raised to a negative exponent, the result is the reciprocal of the base
            raised to the positive of the exponent:<br>
            \(2^{-3}=\frac{1}{2^3}=\frac{1}{8}\)
        </p>

        <p>
            The product of two binomials can be found by multiplying each term in binomial by each other,
            simplifying if necessary.<br>
            <strong>Perfect square trinomial -</strong> A trinomial in the form \(a^2+2ab+b^2\) or \(a^2-2ab+b^2\) that
            is the
            result of squaring two binomials, \((a+b)^2\) or \((a-b)^2\).<br>
            <strong>Difference of squares -</strong> When the sun and the difference of two terms are multiplied
            \((a+b)(a-b)\),
            the answer will be in the form \(a^2-b^2\).<br><br>
            Factoring a polynomial is the opposite of expanding it, you can do so by finding the GCF (greatest
            common factor) of all the terms and dividing them by it. The GCF is not limited to being a
            monomial.<br>
            \(x^2+3x=x(x+3)\)<br>
            To factor by grouping, factor groups of two terms with a common factor to create a binomial common
            factor, factor that.<br>

            A quadratic expression in the form \(x^2+bx+c\) can be factored by finding two integers whose
            product is \(c\), and whose sum is \(b\). Express these terms as a product.<br>
            \(x^2+12x+21=(x+3)(x+9)\)<br>

            A quadratic expression in the form \(ax^2+bx+c\) can be factored by finding two integers whose
            product is \(a\cdot c\), and whose sum is \(b\), break up the middle terms into these two integers,
            and factor by grouping.<br>

        <p>Quadratic expressions can also be perfect square trinomials, or can be solved with the difference of
            squares.

            First factor out a from the first two terms, add the square of half of \(b\) and subtract the same
            value, take the negative value out of the brackets, and simplify the equation.
        </p>

        <p>To solve a quadratic equation, write it in the form \(ax^2+bx+c=0\), factor the left side and solve
            each factor for 0, the solutions are also known as the <strong>roots</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some quadratics cannot be solved through factoring, using the quadratic formula you can find the
            solutions to a quadratic equation. The quadratic equation can be derived through the following
            process.

            The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found through \(-\frac{b}{2a}\)<br>
            The discriminant is the value in the square root of the quadratic formula, it can tell you how many
            roots a quadratic equation has. If \(b^2-4ac\) is positive there are two roots, if 0 there is one
            root, and if negative there are zero roots.

        <p>Some problems can be solved by multiplying two linear expressions together, resulting in a quadratic
            equation which can be solved in one of the ways detailed above.</p>

            modelled by: \(h=-\frac{1}{2}gt^2+v_0t+h_0\) where \(g\) is acceleration due to gravity, 9.8
            m/s\(^2\) on Earth, \(v_0\) is the initial vertical velocity, \(h_0\) is the initial height in
            meters, \(t\) is the time in seconds, and \(h\) is the height meters.
